## Idea of the project

The idea of this project is to develop a cutting-edge supply chain management system for the pharmaceutical industry using blockchain technology, Solidity, and React. The system aims to address critical challenges faced by the pharmaceutical supply chain, such as product traceability, counterfeit prevention, transparency, and efficiency. 



## Goal üöÄ

The objective of this project is to develop a secure and transparent supply chain management system for the pharmaceutical industry using blockchain technology. The system should enable real-time tracking, traceability, and verification of pharmaceutical products at every stage of the supply chain, from supplier to customer, to ensure product authenticity and safety.

## Our Solution üí°

-	Smart Contracts: Develop individual smart contracts for each entity in the supply chain (supplier, manufacturer, etc.). These contracts will facilitate secure transactions, ownership transfers, and product information storage on the blockchain.
- Transparent Tracking: Utilize smart contracts to record product movements and key events throughout the supply chain, ensuring end-to-end traceability.
-	Product Verification: Implement a React-based front-end interface that enables customers to verify product authenticity by scanning unique identifiers and accessing immutable supply chain records.
-	Data Privacy: Ensure data privacy by encrypting sensitive information and employing role-based access control within the smart contracts.
-	Real-time Notifications: Enable stakeholders to receive real-time notifications and alerts for critical supply chain events.
-	Integration: Integrate the front-end and smart contracts using Web3.js to enable seamless communication between the user interface and the blockchain network.
-	Testing and Deployment: Conduct rigorous testing on Remix IDE, compile the smart contracts, and deploy them on a local blockchain using Ganache and Truffle.
-	User Experience: Focus on providing a user-friendly and intuitive interface to enhance stakeholders' experience in interacting with the supply chain management system.

## Getting Started ‚è∞

## To deploy the Smart Contract
-	Install Ganache and create a workspace.
- Install Truffle npm package globally by running `npm install -g truffle`.
-	In the `truffle-config.js` file update the from: address to an address from your Ganache workspace.
-	Run `truffle migrate --reset` from the command line to deploy the smart contract to the blockchain.
-	Download Metamask Chrome extension for the browser to help interaction between the application and the blockchain.
